  <h3>Release 1.0</h3>
	<p>
	  This represents the initial release of the 'core' extensions as a separate specification.  It includes
	  a large number of changes from the set of extensions that were published as part of R4B, but no
	  specific changes were tracked.  Consult <a href="http://jira.hl7.org">HL7's tracker website</a> to
	  see all changes and their rationale.
