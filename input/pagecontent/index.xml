  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This IG defines the extensions used internally by the FHIR tools.
    These extensions should never appear in implementations unless they
    are concerned with code generation from the FHIR packages.

	<h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide and the underlying FHIR specification are licensed as public domain under the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}license.html#license">FHIR license</a>.  The
    license page also describes rules for the use of the FHIR name and logo.
  </p>
  <p>    
    This guide includes extensions making use of terminologies such
    as LOINC and SNOMED CT that have more restrictive licensing requirements.  Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and
    any other constraints of terminologies used as part of their implementation process.  In some cases,
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain codes may be shared with.
