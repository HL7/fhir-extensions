  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    The Extension Pack defines the FHIR extensions that are globally defined and available in 
    all implementation contexts. Prior to <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R5">R5</a>
    these extensions were defined in the core specification, but starting from R5
    they have been moved out of the specification into a separate extensions pack
    so that the extensions can be updated more often than the base specification.
    This extension pack also defines some search parameters for the extensions.
  </p>
  <a name="prior"> </a>
  <p>
  The FHIR Extension Pack is intended for use with 
  <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/support">all supported versions of FHIR</a>. 
  While the Extension Pack definitions are based on R5, most of the extensions can 
  be used as-is or with a little modification with earlier versions of the 
  specification:
  </p>
	<ul>
    <li>There is information on each extension description describing the use of the extension with other FHIR Versions</li>
    <li>A very few extensions can't be used in earlier versions</li>
    <li>There are packages for use with older versions with tooling based packages: <code>hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r4</code> and <code>hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r3</code></li>
    <li>The version of the Extensions Pack (5.3.0-ballot) is not the same as the FHIR version, since it applies equally to 
      FHIR versions R5, R4, R4B, and R3</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Note to Balloters</h3>

  <p>This is the ballot for release 5.3.0 of the Extension Pack. While comment is welcome on all extensions, 
  implementer's attention is drawn to the following matters:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>New Extensions: {!% include new-extensions.xhtml %!}</li>
   <li>Removed Extensions: {!% include deleted-extensions.xhtml %!}</li>
   <li>Deprecated Extensions: There are {% sql Select count(*) from Resources where type = 'StructureDefinition' and sdType = 'Extension' and standardStatus = 'deprecated' %} deprecated extensions: see <a href="deprecated.html">the deprecated Extensions page</a>. Balloters might want to pay particular attention to this list - there has been some lack of clarity about whether extensions should be deprecated when elements are added to resources in R5/6 </li>
   <li>Changed Extensions: You can see which extensions have changed by looking in the <b>Î” v5.2.0</b> column on right of the <a href="extension-registry.html">Extension Summary Table</a></li>
   <li>The conversion maps have been removed from this release - they have moved to the cross-extensions publications</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The FHIR Management Group recognizes the difficulty of balloting the extensions pack
   for the community. The Extensions Pack ballot serves as a checkpoint for the continuous 
   development of the Extension pack content prior to publishing the normal formal milestone,
   and is an opportunity for the community to review and comment on Extensions of interest. 
   Given that there are {% sql Select count(*) from Resources where type = 'StructureDefinition' and sdType = 'Extension' %}
   extensions that span the entire span of the FHIR implementation
   space, there is no expectation that ballot reviewers will be able to review all the 
   resources. For this reason, ballot cycles of the extensions pack do not contribute towards
   extension maturity after the first ballot. There are, however, several structural
   enhancements aimed at addressing extension use tracking and useability:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Extensions now get a direct reference to their page in the FHIR IG Statistics (which itself will be enhanced)</li>
   <li>The <a href="deprecated.html">Deprecation summary table</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  References to the extensions defined in this extension pack are found in <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extensibility.html#Extension">Extension.url</a> 
  or in profile references to defined extensions in <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}elementdefinition.html#ElementDefinition">ElementDefinition.type.profile</a>.
  While the profile references may be versioned using <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}references.html#canonical">canonical versioned references</a>, 
  the most important references are in <code>Extension.url</code> and these are version-less.
  </p>
  <p>
  For this reason, the extensions defined in this extension pack are managed very conservatively with regard to 
  breaking changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Extensions that are active are not subject to breaking changes. New extensions will be introduced if necessary</li>
   <li>Extensions labelled 'draft' may have breaking changes if the FHIR Management Group is satisfied that they are not in 
     use in production, or if all the existing users are agree to making the change. The exact rules and processes still 
     being discussed, but not all 'draft' extensions are subject to change</li>
   <li>In this regard, the definitions for <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}versions.html#change">breaking change to Normative artifacts</a> 
     apply. Note that the focus of these rules is preserving the validity and meaning of existing extensions, not preventing applications 
     processing extensions from having to change</li>
    <li>The extensions all have the status of 'trial-use' but once they are active they are treated as normative. The FHIR
     Management Group has not yet decided how these extensions will be balloted in the future</li>
     <li>If a breaking change needs to be introduced to an extension, the original extension will be marked as deprecated and a new one will be created.  If the scope of the extension has significantly changed, it may be given a completely new URL.  If the scope is largely the same, the url will remain the same, except that a version will be appended.  E.g. "[original url]-v2".  The deprecated extension will have a note added that points to the replacing extension.</li>
  </ul>

	<h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide and the underlying FHIR specification are licensed as public domain under the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}license.html#license">FHIR license</a>.  The
    license page also describes rules for the use of the FHIR name and logo.
  </p>
  <p>    
    This guide includes extensions making use of terminologies such
    as LOINC and SNOMED CT that have more restrictive licensing requirements.  Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and
    any other constraints of terminologies used as part of their implementation process.  
    Licencing requirements may limit the systems to which data recorded using certain codes may be shared.
