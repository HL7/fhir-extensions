  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This IG defines the extensions that are globally defined and available in 
    all FHIR implementation contexts. Prior to <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R5">R5</a>
    these extensions were defined in the  core specification, but starting from R5
    they have been moved out of the specification into a separate extensions pack
    so that the extensions can be updated more often than the base specification.
    This extension pack also defines some search parameters for the extensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, the extension pack also contains a series of <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}mapping-language.html">mapping language</a>
    scripts that provide a formal executable definition of the relationship between 
    R5 and the prior versions R4 and R4B. These are located in the extension pack to allow 
    them to also be updated as they are tested and used in production and improvements are made.
  </p>

  <h3>Note to Balloters</h3>

  <p>This is the ballot for release 5.3.0 of the Extension Pack. While comment is welcome on all extensions, 
  implementer's attention is drawn to the following matters:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>New Extensions:</li>
   <li>Removed Extensions: No extensions have been removed</li>
   <li>Deprecated Extensions: see <a ref="deprecated.html">the deprecated Extensions page</a>. Balloters might want to pay particular attention to this list - there has been some lack of clarity about whether extensions should be deprecated when elements </li>
   <li>Changed Extensions: You can see which extensions have changed by looking in the <b>Î” v5.2.0</b> column on right of the <a href="extension-registry.html">Extension Summary Table</a></li>
   <li>The conversion maps have been removed from this release - they have moved to the cross-extensions publications</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The FHIR Management Group recognizes the difficulty of balloting the extensions pack
   for implementers, and balloters are advised that ballot cycles of the extensions pack
   to not contribute towards extension maturity after the first ballot. There are several
   structural enhancements aimed at addressing extension use tracking and useability:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Extensions now get a direct reference to their page in the FHIR IG Statistics (which itself will be enhanced)</li>
   <li>The Deprecation summary table below</li>
  </ul>

	<h3>Using the extensions with older versions of FHIR</h3>
  <p>
  The Extensions Pack uses R5 internally, and the main definition of the Extensions 
  is based on R5. Most of the extensions can be used as-is or with a little modification
  with earlier versions of the specification. Notes for use with other versions:
  </p>
	<ul>
    <li>There is information on each extension description describing the use of the extension with other FHIR Versions</li>
    <li>A very few extensions can't be used in earlier versions</li>
    <li>There are packages for use with older versions with tooling based packages: <code>hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r4</code> and <code>hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r3</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  References to the extensions defined in this extension pack are found in <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extensibility.html#Extension">Extension.url</a> 
  or in profile references to defined extensions in <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}elementdefinition.html#ElementDefinition">ElementDefinition.type.profile</a>.
  While the profile references may be versioned using <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}references.html#canonical">canonical versioned references</a>, 
  the most important references are in <code>Extension.url</code> and these are version-less.
  </p>
  <p>
  For this reason, the extensions defined in this extension pack are managed very conservatively with regard to 
  breaking changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Extensions that are active are not subject to breaking changes. New extensions will be introduced if necessary</li>
   <li>Extensions labelled 'draft' may have breaking changes if the FHIR Management Group is satisfied that they are not in 
     use in production, or if all the existing users are agree to making the change. The exact rules and processes still 
     being discussed, but not all 'draft' extensions are subject to change</li>
   <li>In this regard, the definitions for <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}versions.html#change">breaking change to Normative artifacts</a> 
     apply. Note that the focus of these rules is preserving the validity and meaning of existing extensions, not preventing applications 
     processing extensions from having to change</li>
    <li>The extensions all have the status of 'trial-use' but once they are active they are treated as normative. The FHIR
     Management Group has not yet decided how these extensions will be balloted in the future</li>
     <li>If a breaking change needs to be introduced to an extension, the original extension will be marked as deprecated and a new one will be created.  If the scope of the extension has significantly changed, it may be given a completely new URL.  If the scope is largely the same, the url will remain the same, except that a version will be appended.  E.g. "[original url]-v2".  The deprecated extension will have a note added that points to the replacing extension.</li>
  </ul>

	<h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide and the underlying FHIR specification are licensed as public domain under the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}license.html#license">FHIR license</a>.  The
    license page also describes rules for the use of the FHIR name and logo.
  </p>
  <p>    
    This guide includes extensions making use of terminologies such
    as LOINC and SNOMED CT that have more restrictive licensing requirements.  Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and
    any other constraints of terminologies used as part of their implementation process.  
    Licencing requirements may limit the systems to which data recorded using certain codes may be shared.
