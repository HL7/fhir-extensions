When the Activity Status is set to “Inactive”, the Activity Status Date is the date-time when the Value Set Definition version becomes Inactive. This cycle may happen multiple times. The specified time is expected to be one second after midnight UTC of the Activity Status Date. The date may be in the future. \n\nIt is strongly encouraged that the Activity Status be set such that no more than one Value Set Definition Version for a single Value Set Identifier can have an Activity Status of ACTIVE at the same time within a single realm. In cases where this is not true, evaluation of the alignment of a Value Set Expansion Code Set to a specific Value Set Definition, as referenced in a CD, will be problematic.\n\nChanges to this element should never result in a new Value Set Definition Version.",
