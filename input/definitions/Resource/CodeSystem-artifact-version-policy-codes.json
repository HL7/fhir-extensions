This is a common versioning policy often used when artifacts are published as part of an implementation guide, and is important to consider as it indicates that there may be version changes _without_ corresponding changes in the content of a particular artifact. For example, if an implementation guide includes questionnaires, new versions of that implementation guide may include new questionnaires, but not change existing ones, and in this case, with package-managed versions, the existing questionnaires that had no actual changes would still be published with a new version."
