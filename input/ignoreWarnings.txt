# We expect several extensions that aren't in shareablevalueset.  So long as the extensions are valid in their location and defined, we're ok

HL7 Defined CodeSystems should ensure that every concept has a definition
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# This is actually caused by an error in the definition of the CodeSystem in THO. We've created a task to fix that
VALUESET_BAD_FILTER_VALUE_VALID_CODE

# can't validate for some value sets
VALUESET_INC_TOO_MANY_CODES

# known references to draft items

# These codes properties are intended to be internal codes
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/obligation: CodeSystem.property[2]: The type of property 'code' is 'code', but no ValueSet information was found, so the codes will be validated as internal codes

# This is OK by a recent decision of the TI workgroup, but the validator hasn't yet been updated for the decision
The property 'status' has no definition in CodeSystem.property. Many terminology tools won't know what to do with it

Pinned the version of http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/value-filter-comparator to 5.3.0-ballot from choices of 5.0.0 (hl7.fhir.r5.core#5.0.0), 5.3.0-ballot (hl7.fhir.uv.extensions#5.3.0-ballot)
